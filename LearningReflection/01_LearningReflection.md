# Learning Reflection

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- My experience testing Gitlab was a challenge, in real life, I'd be testing based on given requirements and expected outcomes. For this website, I had to test first. It's not easy to register twice, what with browser cache, so it was a case of using the site first, and then writing the procedure based on the results, which is of course backwards. Still though, it's easy to see the point. We'd have these requirements and expected outcomes already, writing our tests based on those.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- My process was to open the given page, and go through the given process, and note the results, and then log each step, and expected result from there, at least for the positive test cases. For the negative test cases, I tried as best as I found possible to do the opposite of the positive tests. It wasn't always possible, but I tried to find a negative test for every positive.
    
## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
- The only recommendation I have is to not use .txt files. Adjusting the tabs is a nightmare, and led to lots of extra github commits. Also IA Writer is a nice markdown editor, but you can't make commits from it.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used VS Code, commiting to Github all my changes as I progressed through the project.
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I had some problems with a conflict with the email address I used for Gitlab, and Github, then testing registration through Github, but that was it, and just took a bit of time and annoyance, one of those normal things to just work through.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I needed to do a rebase, but that was my fault, I didn't have any data loss or anything like that. I've been using Github for a while now. I've had an account for years, but my heaviest usage has been with Integrify, as well as personal projects.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- This question is better answered in the next part, as I don't have experience in automations, besides some devops experience in bash scripting, and the course specifically didn't cover automations. I have no preference to langauge or frameworks in general though. It's more just what the best tool for a given job is, and these tools are always changing. I suppose I would favor the one that my workplace favored.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- The most popular requirement is of course the one thing we lack, experience. Past that, Python, C++, C# are all popular, as is Robot Framework. I've also seen Bash, Jenkins, and Gitlab mentioned, as well as experience with Jira and Agile methodologies.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- To persue a career, I run into a barrier right out the gate, in that in order to get experience, I need to already have experience. That aside, I'd need to learn Robot Framework and any other popular automation frameworks, and to brush up on my bash scripting, how to use Python/C++/C# specifically for automations.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- The most challenging thing for me in this course was all the memorization for the quizzes. The course videos, and their tests at the end were all just memorization. The theory doesn't mean a lot unless I can see it used, to walk through a test process. 

- Writing the test scenarios was a nice payoff to all the memorization, but I still won't really know if I did it right. I have questions still about the syntax of writing the scenarios, but at the end, these questions won't be answered really, so did I learn right? I won't know until after the grade, and I won't see the correct way.

- I feel like at some point, we have to get away from intro courses. It's ok to assume that in an IT program, that we should know something about code, that it's ok to let us start learning automations. After all, it wasn't even covered in this course, but this learning reflection includes. The course should include it too, at some point we have to take away the training wheels.

- I hope this course was good practice for my documention, and good practice thinking about the testing process and procedures, but I won't really know, or see what I could have done better.
